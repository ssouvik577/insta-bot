Using automated scripts to interact with websites, especially social media platforms like Instagram, might violate their terms of service, and they may take actions against accounts engaging in such activities. It is essential to review the website's terms of service and guidelines before automating any interactions. Always use automation responsibly and for legitimate purposes.
